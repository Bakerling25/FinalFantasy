        Welcome to our site about FFXIV. This site is meant for new as well as experienced players. 
On this site you will be able to find tips and guides about the different classes.
We hope that it can help you to either figure what class you want to play or give you some extra tips to help your playstyle.
If you see a video on this site, there is a high likelyhood that is't made by the YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQjKMGUEzBmEHltb1OIMLUg">LarryZaur</a>, example look to your right.
<br>
We will also help you with the sub-jobs, Disciple of the Land (DotL) and Disciple of the hand (DotH).
<br>
Disciple of the land is all about going out into the world and gathering ressources in which you can craft new items with.
<br>
Disciple of the Hand is all about making items out the the things you've collected. Found some new metal while mining?
Check your black- and goldsmithing job to see if you can create something new.
Killed a sheep, and it drooped some fleece? Check your weaver, what new stuff can you make with that?
Disicple of the Hand is all about making your new stuff to progress the game or to make some gil selling it on the marketplace.
<br>
Other than that we also have a section for the Free Companies (Guilds), where we will descripe how they work,
as well as ...(to be continued)
<br>
And lastly we have set up a player search function, so if at any point you want
to look at your own stats, your friends or a 'future' friend you've met online, you can do so here.
